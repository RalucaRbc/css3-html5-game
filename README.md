# css3 html5 game

This is a pure CSS and HTML game. If you disable the JavaScript engine in your browser it will still work. There are no images loaded to generate the graphics, everything is CSS, pure CSS :)

Note: best viewed on potrait mode from your mobile or the mobile emulator in your web developer tool (chrome inspector or similar).

This is not intended to reach production. It is an experiment to push the the limits of CSS.
